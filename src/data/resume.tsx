  summary:
    "I've been building websites and web applications since 2005. My journey with technology and coding has been one of continous learning and hands on development. I started out in the days of Flash and basic HTML/CSS and have navigated the changing landscape with a solid understanding of Javascript, PHP and a Information Architecture. I've been working with React.js since 2015 and have navigated the changes with that library over the past decade, including learning Next js.  My Drupal experience dates back to 2007.  I am a very flexible developer who can work on multiple technology platforms and deliver results.  I have a strong work ethic and pride myself on taking ownership of projects and delivering on deadline.",

This creates a platform where the consumer can get data on clean vehicles in conjunction with rebates and incentives that are offered in California. Recently upgraded to Drupal 10 with the bootstrap framework for the UI. The site has two main objectives, to highlight clean vehicles (ev, hybrid and hydrogen) and showcase the incentives and rebates available when one is purchased.
